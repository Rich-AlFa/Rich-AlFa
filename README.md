## About Me!

Hi, I'm Rich! 👋

I'm an adventurer, sports enthusiast, and music lover with a strong passion for technology and the powerful stories hidden in data. My journey has led me to data analysis, where I love turning raw information from diverse sources into clear, high-impact answers that drive smarter business decisions.
  
Today, I'm a **results-oriented Data Analyst** with a solid background in operations management, quality control, process optimization, and technical support. With **+6 years** of hands-on experience in reporting, quality assurance, and operational metrics, I bring both analytical rigor and a practical mindset to every project.

In my current role as a **Operations Manager** at AB&TS, I apply these skills daily. I manage and prepare large datasets for our sales team by performing extraction, cleaning, and filtering. A key part of my role involves overseeing our dialing software and making data-driven adjustments to optimize resources, improve sales, and align with client requests and staffing needs.

### Technical Skills 🛠️

I am proficient with a variety of tools and methodologies to tackle data challenges from start to finish.

* **Programming & Machine Learning:** Python (including Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy) and SQL
* **Visualization & Dashboards:** Tableau, Power BI, Seaborn, and Matplotlib
* **Business & Statistical Analysis:** My experience includes A/B testing, cohort analysis, predictive analysis, descriptive statistics, and hypothesis testing
* **Software:** Proficient in MS Office Suite (Excel, Outlook) and Google Drive tools (Sheets, Forms)

### My Goals 🚀

Actively deepening my expertise in **Python, AI, cloud computing and machine learning** to drive greater impact for the teams and organizations I work with.

Currently seeking a full-time **Data Analyst** position where I can bring my analytical mindset and problem-solving skills to a forward-thinking company while continuing to grow.
