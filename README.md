## About Me

Hi, I'm Rich! üëã

I'm an adventurer, sports enthusiast, and music lover who recently discovered a passion for technology and the stories that data can tell. My journey has led me to a career in data analysis, where I thrive on transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable insights that drive business decisions.

I am a recent graduate of the **Data Analyst bootcamp from Tripleten**, where I gained hands-on experience by completing 13 projects based on real-world scenarios. This immersive program provided me with a solid foundation across the entire data analysis lifecycle.

In my current role as a **Campaign Manager** at AB&TS, I apply these skills daily. I manage and prepare large datasets for our sales team by performing extraction, cleaning, and filtering operations. A key part of my role involves overseeing our dialing software and making data-driven adjustments to optimize resources, improve sales, and align with client requests and staffing needs.

### Technical Skills üõ†Ô∏è

I am proficient with a variety of tools and methodologies to tackle data challenges from start to finish.

* **Programming & Machine Learning:** Python (including Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy) and SQL
* **Visualization & Dashboards:** Tableau, Power BI, Seaborn, and Matplotlib
* **Business & Statistical Analysis:** My experience includes A/B testing, cohort analysis, predictive analysis, descriptive statistics, and hypothesis testing
* **Software:** Proficient in MS Office Suite (Excel, Outlook) and Google Drive tools (Sheets, Forms)

### My Goals üöÄ

I am actively seeking to expand my knowledge in **Python, AI, and machine learning** to make a greater impact. My immediate goal is to transition into a full-time Data Analyst role where I can contribute my analytical mindset and problem-solving abilities to a forward-thinking organization and continue to grow my skills.

I'm always open to connecting and collaborating. Feel free to reach out!
